potentially:
auto
const
float
int
struct
void
enum

break
continue
for
while
do
switch
case
default



I want:
either
- boxes instead of pointers AND structs or arrays
OR
- tables that are always reference type


----
- boxes instead of pointers
    - boxes are reference pointers to a copy of a value that exists in that scope only?
        e.g. x = 4; box b = box(x); x = 7; x != unbox(b);
        setbox(b, unbox(b) + 2);
- tables instead of structs?
- vectors or arrays or something
- hashtable? or dictionary?
