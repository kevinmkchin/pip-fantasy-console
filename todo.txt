## Todo

/** TODO

   - account for GCObject TValue type in interpreter and parser

    - tables (require gc)
    - strings (require gc)
    - garbage collecting

    - floats

    - elif
    - while
    - for
    
 Way the fuck down the line:
    - use custom assert for mesascript
    - replace all std::vectors with custom data struct
    - REFACTOR

- GUI incorrect zones when window resize
  - prob cuz mouse x y will be incorrect.
- Make sure vertext height thing didn't regress (text height inconsistency for loading vs forming vertices)
- Game GUI atomics
- Editor camera & game camera

I want:
either
- boxes instead of pointers AND structs or arrays
OR
- tables that are always reference type


----
- boxes instead of pointers
    - boxes are reference pointers to a copy of a value that exists in that scope only?
        e.g. x = 4; box b = box(x); x = 7; x != unbox(b);
        setbox(b, unbox(b) + 2);
- tables instead of structs?
- vectors or arrays or something
- hashtable? or dictionary?
