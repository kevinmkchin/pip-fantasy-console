# Mesa GCS Manual

## What is Mesa GCS?

The Mesa Game Creation System is a tool for creating games. It's designed to be fun, frictionless, and easy to learn.

Mesa is created and maintained by https://kevch.in/ with the [Handmade](https://handmade.network/) ethos. Every piece of code that goes into Mesa is written from scratch with love. The only library used is [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) for windowing and input across platforms. Everything else, from the GUI to the coding language, has been written from scratch. Mesa uses an OpenGL 3.3 backend for cross platform graphics.

Ultimately, this is a toy game engine made for my personal enjoyment, but it is powerful enough for real use.
