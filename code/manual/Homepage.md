# Mesa GCS Manual

## What is Mesa GCS?

The Mesa Game Creation System is a tool for creating games. It's designed to be fun, frictionless, and easy to learn.

Mesa is created and maintained by https://kevch.in/ with the [Handmade](https://handmade.network/) ethos. Every piece of code that goes into Mesa is written from scratch with love. The only library used is [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) for windowing and input across platforms. Mesa uses an OpenGL 3.3 backend for cross platform graphics.
